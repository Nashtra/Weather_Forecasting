                        <p>We developed an operational solar fare prediction model using deep neural networks, named Deep Flare Net (DeFN). 
                            DeFN can issue probabilistic forecasts of solar fares in two categories, such as ≥M-class and M-class events or 
                            ≥ C-class and C-class events, occurring in the next 24 h after observations and the maximum class of fares occurring in the next 24 h. DeFN is set to run every 6 h and has been operated since January 2019.</p>
